We hit 500 members earlier this week, so first of all, thank you all so much for being here. Despite having a lot of members, there are very few of us who are regularly active, and we'd love to see that number grow even more than we like seeing the member counter grow. So, for those of you who may be reading this but are inactive, we want your input.

What can we, as a server and as a moderation team, do to get you more involved in the server? What do you want to see change? What kind of events would you like us to host? Put your answers in suggestions-and-feedback 

Now that I have some free time, I'd love to run a simple group project for us, without dealing with the infrastructure since it seems like the templates intimidated people, so if you have an idea for that, post that as well.

Thanks for being such a great community.
