# About Python_Practice
Since being founded in April of 2021, our mission has
been to build a safe and inclusive community for programmers of all skill levels.
We live by the phrase "theres no such thing as a stupid question", and encourage 
everyone to ask any question, regardless of complexity or repetitiveness.
We are not StackOverflow, and we don't care if someone else asked the question already.
We want you to learn without being discouraged.

Our mod staff consists of a team of three who have been community members since 
the beginning. They enforce the Code of Conduct and are available for anything the
community needs.

We value community feedback. If you have any suggestions, post them in the "suggestions
to improve the server" channel.
